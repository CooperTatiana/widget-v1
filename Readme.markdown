# Widget 1.0

Starting in [Corona](http://www.coronalabs.com) [daily build](http://developer.coronalabs.com/downloads/daily-builds) 1034, we rewrote our widget library from scratch (widget 2.0), so we are releasing widget 1.0 to the Corona community.

## Warning

We should warn you that this code is very spaghetti-like. It's not clean and is highly unmaintainable. It is really an anti-pattern for any budding framework writer. 

When you read this code, you should see right away why we struggled so much to maintain the old widget code, and why we ultimately decided to rewrite the widget library.

## Why this may be useful

Given all of that, why are we releasing it? 

We made some breaking changes in widget 2.0, so for those of you who really desperately need widget 1.0, we are giving it to you to use as you see fit.

## License

We are releasing this under the BSD license. See top of widget.lua for more info.
